## Update 1.9 issue
For some reason, Update 1.9 appears to have broken this mod for some players now. I have no idea how Paradox could break this mod, considering it's just two lines after Update 1.5.

After my study, it seems to be caused by tours and tournaments, which I haven't purchased yet. If anyone can help by creating an issue post on GitHub and providing a clip or screenshot to demonstrate what this bug looks like, it would greatly assist me in fixing this issue. Additionally, if you can fix this issue and create a pull request, it would be highly appreciated.

# Compatibly
Because it's based on scripted_widgets, it should be compatible with most of the mods, praise the Paradox.
